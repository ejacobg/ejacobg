### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jacob!

An aspiring full stack developer, with a focus on the backend. I'm currently looking for work in the Las Vegas, NV area.

I'm dedicated to learning and sharing my knowledge with others. You may find everything that I've worked on over the past year on my [website](https://ejacobg.com/).

ðŸ§° My toolkit includes Go/Golang, C#, and JavaScript.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently brushing up on LeetCode problems.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, microservices, and Kubernetes.
